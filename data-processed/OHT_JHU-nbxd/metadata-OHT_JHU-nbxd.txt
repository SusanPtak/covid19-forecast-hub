methods: NN based on N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al. 2000) for univariate time series, adapted to work on an encoding of multiple input variables. Architecture is also extended to provide error variance forecasts.
methods_long: Neural network model based on N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al. 2000), which is a residual block type architecture that generates point forecasts from univariate time series data. The network accepts a fixed lookback window of time points as input, and has a set number of output nodes corresponding to the length of the forecast horizon. We extend the network with additional residual blocks that output error variance forecasts (evaluated using a likelihood loss function) which allows generating quantile forecasts, assuming a parametric (gamma) error distribution. Additional predictor variables are incorporated using a temporal convolutional network (TCN; Bai et al. 2018). The TCN accepts one input channel for each predictor time series (or static variable), including past values of the target variable, and outputs a single channel with the same length as the lookback window. The TCN output channel is used as the input to the extended N-BEATS network. Each value in the TCN output sequence is a non-linear combination of the predictor variables at that point and all previous points in the lookback window, which preserves the temporal structure of the input.
